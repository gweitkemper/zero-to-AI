## Audience - anyone at 3Cloud interested in learning hand-on AI and Python


## Your Guide - Chris Joakim

## Goals

- Introduce you to Application Development with Git, GitHub, and Python
- Introduce you to the most relevant Azure PaaS Services for AI
- Introduce you to AI
- **"Teach you to Fish"** in ~20 **bite-size** lessons/sessions

## Why did I volunteer to create and teach this course?

- I've seen the need, at Microsoft, for technical enablement amongst my peers
- I see the same need at 3Cloud
- Hands-on enablement in Python and AI can unleash your understanding, skills, value, success
- To put us in a better position to understand and serve our customers

## Series Content - GitHub, Teams Meetings, Teams Channel

- All content will be in GitHub, for your reference
- Primitive markdown content (like this page), and the simplest-possible Python code
- A mix of concepts and hands-on; more hands-on
  - Description, Topics, Images, Demonstration, Links, and Pro Tips
- Minimal number of hyperlinks to external content
- No flashy PowerPoint presentations
- We'll record each Teams meeting for your reference

## Each Session

- A "Bite-size" 30-minute Teams meetings
- First five minutes for Q&A from previous Session
- Next 15-20 minutes for presentation and demonstration
- Last 5-10 minutes for questions and discussion
- Post your questions in the Teams meeting chat

## Let's build a Learning Community in Teams

- Help each other.  Learn from each other.
- I'll monitor the Teams channel, but my time for 1:1s is limited

## Azure

- You won't use Azure Portal in this series
- I'll share read-only keys to Azure resources instead
- You don't have to provision Azure resources
- Don't create or configure the Azure resources used in this series
- But learn in another Azure Subscription if you wish to

## Homework

- Just execute the lesson samples yourself, and look at the code
- All code in this series can be executed from your laptop
- Visit the referenced links in each lesson

## Expectation/Hope

- Focus on learning; absorb what you can
- The hardest sessions will be on installing git, python, uv
- Get a working git, python, and uv on your laptop ASAP
- Please stay engaged, don't drop out if you feel you're falling behind
- There will be time to catch up
- Please excute the sample programs in the lessons; hands-on is important for learning
- Be curious
- Lean forward, engage, ask questions

## Out of Scope

- Microsoft Fabric
- Databricks (but Jupyter and Notebooks are covered)
- Provisioning Azure resources
- DevOps
- LangChain; the focus is on Microsoft and Agent Framework
- Other programming languages
- A Certificate or exam at the end of the series; just learn

## In Summary, the Goal is to **"Teach you to Fish" regarding AI, with Python**
