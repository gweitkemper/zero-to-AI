# Part 1, Session 3 - A Python CLI (Command Line Interface) Program


## In this session we'll cover the following topics:

- Running a Python program from the command line
- The **__main__** entry point
- Importing standard libraries, third-party libraries, and our own code
- Command Line Arguments
- Branching with the **if**, **elif**, and **else** statements
- Looping/Iteration with the **for** statement
- Environment Variables
- Exception Handling with the **try** and **except** statements
  - Ignore the exceptions with the **pass** statement in this example program
- Built-in functions - float() and sorted()
- Invoking HTTP GET requests synchronously and asynchronously with the **httpx** library
- Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming
- Common Built-in Datatypes you'll use in every program:
  - str - string values (text values, such as "Hello, World!")
  - int - integer numbers
  - float - floating-point numbers
  - dict - dictionary, a set of key-value pairs, such as os.environ
  - list - an array of sequential values, such as sys.argv
- Indentation matters in Python
  - It must be properly indented or you'll get an error at runtime

This session uses file **main-cli-sample.py** as our Python CLI program.

Python is a relatively simple language, and this sample program
goes far in demonstrating the core concepts of the language.

## Wait, do I need to know Python immediately!?

**No!  Learn at your own pace, in time.  Please absorb what you can now.**

Resource like the following can be helpful.

- [Real Python Cheat Sheet](https://realpython.com/cheatsheets/python/)

## What does this program do?

Let's execute it to ask it for help.

```
python main-cli-sample.py help
```

It responds with:

```
Usage:
  python main-cli-sample.py <func>
  python main-cli-sample.py add_numbers 1 2 3 4 5
  python main-cli-sample.py add_numbers_better 1 2 3 4 oops 5
  python main-cli-sample.py print_environment_variables
  python main-cli-sample.py download_openflights_airports
  python main-cli-sample.py download_openflights_airports_async
Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen
  --version     Show version
```

<br><br><br>

### Wait, how was that help content created?

The program uses the **docopt** library for this.

It's important give users of your program instructions on how to use it.

We define our help content in a multi-line string comment at the top of the file.

Python multi-line string values begin with three double quotes (""") and end with three double quotes (""").

## Demonstration 

These topics are best described by walking through the the code and executing it.

### Add Numbers provided on the command line

```
python main-cli-sample.py add_numbers 1 2 3 4 5

sys.argv: ['main-cli-sample.py', 'add_numbers', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
1
2
3
4
5
The total is 15.0
```

Let's try it with an invalid number.

```
python main-cli-sample.py add_numbers 1 2 3 4 oops 5

sys.argv: ['main-cli-sample.py', 'add_numbers', '1', '2', '3', '4', 'oops', '5']
1
2
3
4
oops
could not convert string to float: 'oops'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/cjoakim/github/zero-to-AI-private/python/main-cli-sample.py", line 100, in <module>
    add_numbers()
    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^
  File "/Users/cjoakim/github/zero-to-AI-private/python/main-cli-sample.py", line 46, in add_numbers
    n = float(arg)  # convert the command line string value to a floating-point number
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'oops'
```

---

### Add Numbers provided on the command line, but with exception handling

```
python main-cli-sample.py add_numbers_better 1 2 3 4 oops 5
1
2
3
4
oops
5
The total is 15.0
```

oops is not a number, so it is ignored.

The **try/except** statement is used to catch exceptions, and either handle or ignore them.

---

### Print Environment Variables

Display the environment variable names on your system, or in the **.env** file,
in sorted order with the **sorted()** built-in function.

```
python main-cli-sample.py print_environment_variables

...
AZURE_COSMOSDB_EMULATOR_ACCT
AZURE_COSMOSDB_EMULATOR_KEY
AZURE_COSMOSDB_EMULATOR_URI
AZURE_COSMOSDB_NOSQL_ACCT
AZURE_COSMOSDB_NOSQL_AUTHTYPE
AZURE_COSMOSDB_NOSQL_CONN_STR
AZURE_COSMOSDB_NOSQL_KEY
AZURE_COSMOSDB_NOSQL_URI
...
```

Create or edit the .env file in the python directory, and run this again.
You should see the your new environment variable(s).

---

### Download OpenFlights Airports

This uses the **httpx** library to invoke an HTTP GET request to the OpenFlights API.

```
python main-cli-sample.py download_openflights_airports

 python main-cli-sample.py download_openflights_airports | head
response: <Response [200 OK]>
response.status_code: 200
response.text: 1,"Goroka Airport","Goroka","Papua New Guinea","GKA","AYGA",-6.081689834590001,145.391998291,5282,10,"U","Pacific/Port_Moresby","airport","OurAirports"

### Code Formatting

This program was formatted using the **ruff** program.

It's good to use a standard code style on your projects as it 
enhances readability and reduces team friction.

```
ruff format main-cli-sample.py
1 file reformatted
```
